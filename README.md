# Space Tourism Website

## Description

This project was undertaken as a challenge to replicate a multi-page space tourism website design. Utilizing React Router for navigation, Tailwind CSS for styling, React for building, and Contentful as a headless CMS for storing site data in a database, I successfully recreated the design as closely as possible.

## Technologies Used

- **React Router**: Used for navigation between different pages of the website.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Employed for styling the components and ensuring responsiveness across various screen sizes.
- **React**: Utilized as the primary framework for building the website's frontend components.
- **Contentful Headless CMS**: Used as the backend to store and manage site data, enabling easy content updates without altering the codebase.
